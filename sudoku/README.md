# Sudoku Solver

### Project Description

This project is unique in that I did it for fun :)
It solves sudokus with a backtracking. It accomplishes a lot of the same things that my N Queens project does, except I had that experience while I coded this one so I believe it turned out a lot better and cleaner. I also made it faster.

### Files

puzzle.csv - the format for a sudoku puzzle input
solution.csv - the output of my program when run with a puzzle like puzzle.csv
sudoku.py - script that runs a backtracking algorithm to find the solution to the input puzzle
