# Hidden Markov Model

Python (Fall 2022)

### Project Description

A self-driving car or robo-car is a vehicle that is capable of sensing its environment and moving safely with little or no human input

 

For this project, you will design a car agent that uses a simple sensor to locate other cars so your robo-car can drive safely.
(Note: the idea was borrowed from Chris Piech at Stanford. https://stanford.edu/~cpiech/cs221/homework/prog/driverlessCar/driverlessCar.html#emission)

Assumptions:

1. The world is a 2D NxN grid. All cars reside on the grid points.
2. Your agent senses the environment through a microphone. Assume each of the K other cars moves independently and that the noise in sensor readings for each car is also independent. For simplicity, in this project, we assume there are only one other car besides your car agent. (K=1)
3. At each time step t, you know where you agent is, a pair of coordinates representing the actual location (for example agentt = (4, 5)), and a noise estimate of the distance to the other car (for example et = 3.5).
4. Where the car resides at time t (carXt, carYt) is unobserved (�hidden�), but the car moves according to a local conditional distribution p(direction|location), for example at (1, 5), the probability the car moves to (2, 5) is 0.6, to (1, 4 is 0.1, to (1,6) is 0.2, to (0, 5) is 0.1. Assuming the transition probability does not change with time and it varies only with locations.
5. The signal et (from the microphone) your robo-car receives at time t is a Gaussian random variable with mean equal to the true distance between your agent and the other car and variance σ2 (let�s assume σ is two-thirds of the length of the car). (for example, if your agent is at (4, 5) and the car is at (1, 5), the actual distance is 3, but et might be 3.4 or 2.8.
6. Initial belief: you will update your belief based on new evidence perceived. But, before any readings, you believe the car could be anywhere: a uniform prior.

Your job is to track the car so you (your robo-car) can drive safely and automatically.
