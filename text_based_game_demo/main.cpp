the character builder function uses a file containing possible character data and compares it to choices made by the player.
choices are validated and stored in an array that contains all the traits and the name of the character.
This sheet was intended to unlock special gameplay options based on your appearance ie. if you are short enough, you
can fit into really tight spaces. sadly, the story was not developed enough to implement these types of choices.
But with this function already written, these comparisons could easily be implemented in a full game.
