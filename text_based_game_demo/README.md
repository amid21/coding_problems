## Project Description
###### C++ (Fall 2020)

This project was an open-ended display of everything we worked on in CS1 from 
file I/O to vectors to pointers. I decided to make a text-based videogame I called
"Ask For Directions"

### Files

#### main.cpp 
Driver code for the whole game. 
	  (As I made this in comp sci 1,
	   There isn't much separate compilation or object oriented
	   programming going on. Everything takes place functionally in
	   the main program)

#### Character.txt 
Contains all the available character customization options

#### Items.txt 
Contains all the items in the game.
